# XSS Defenses

## Understanding XSS Vulnerabilities

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a security vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. These scripts can perform actions on behalf of users or steal sensitive information.

### Types of XSS
1. **Stored XSS**: Malicious scripts are stored on the server (e.g., in a database) and served to users.
2. **Reflected XSS**: Malicious scripts are reflected off the web server, usually via a URL or form input.
3. **DOM-based XSS**: Malicious scripts execute as a result of modifying the DOM environment in the browser.

## Common XSS Defenses

### 1. Input Validation and Sanitization
- **Validate Input**: Ensure that all user inputs conform to expected formats. Use allow-lists (whitelists) to restrict input types and values.
- **Sanitize Input**: Clean input data to remove potentially harmful content before storing or processing it.

### 2. Output Encoding
- **Escape Output**: Convert special characters to HTML entities when displaying user-generated content. This prevents the browser from interpreting them as executable code.
- **Context-Specific Encoding**: Apply different encoding methods depending on where the content is placed (e.g., HTML body, attributes, JavaScript).

### 3. Use Security Libraries
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Implement CSP headers to restrict the sources from which scripts can be loaded and executed.
- **Sanitization Libraries**: Use libraries such as [bleach](https://bleach.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) or [DOMPurify](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify) to clean and sanitize HTML input.

### 4. Avoid Dangerous Practices
- **Avoid Inline JavaScript**: Avoid using inline JavaScript and event handlers in HTML, as they can be a vector for XSS attacks.
- **Use Safe APIs**: Use safe APIs and avoid dynamically generating HTML or JavaScript from user inputs.

### 5. Secure Framework Practices
- **Template Engines**: Use secure template engines that automatically escape content. For example, in Flask, the Jinja2 template engine escapes content by default.
- **Regular Updates**: Keep libraries and frameworks updated to patch known security vulnerabilities.
